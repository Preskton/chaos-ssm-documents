Collection of [SSM
Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-ssm-docs.html).

These documents let you perform chaos engineering experiments on
resources (applications, network, and infrastructure) in the [AWS
Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com).

SSM Automation documents:
=========================

To use SSM Automation, check [the
link](https://medium.com/@adhorn/creating-your-own-chaos-monkey-with-aws-systems-manager-automation-6ad2b06acf20)

-   Support for (randomly) stopping EC2 instances via API
-   Support for (randomly) stopping EC2 instances via AWS Lambda
-   Support for (randomly) terminating EC2 instances via API
-   Support for detaching EBS volumes from EC2 instances via API
    (ec2, ebs)
-   Support for rebooting RDS instance with proper tags via API
-   Support for CPU stress scenario via Run Command

Upload an SSM Automation document:
==================================

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
aws ssm create-document --name "StopRandomInstances-API" --content file://stop-random-instance-api.yml --document-type "Automation" --document-format YAML
```

SSM Run Command documents:
==========================

To use SSM Run Command, please check [this
link](https://medium.com/@adhorn/injecting-chaos-to-amazon-ec2-using-amazon-system-manager-ca95ee7878f5)

**Support Canceling & Rollback (10s max)**


-   Support for killing a process by name using `kill-process.yml`
-   Support for CPU stress using `cpu-stress.yml`
-   Support for IO stress using `io-stress.yml`
-   Support for memory stress using `memory-stress.yml`
-   Support for diskspace stress using `diskspace-stress.yml`
-   Support for latency injection to network traffic on a particular network interface using `latency-stress.yml`
-   Support for latency injection with jitter to outgoing or incoming traffic from a configurable list of sources (Supported: IPv4, IPv4/CIDR, Domain name, DYNAMODB|S3) using `latency-stress-sources.yml`
-   Support for packet loss injection to network traffic on a particular network interface using `network-loss-stress.yml`
-   Support for packet loss injection to outgoing or incoming traffic from a configurable list of sources (Supported: IPv4, IPv4/CIDR, Domain name, DYNAMODB|S3) using `network-loss-sources.yml`


**Experimental**

-   Support for blackhole S3 stress using `blackhole-s3-stress.yml`
-   Support for blackhole DynamoDB stress using `blackhole-dynamo-stress.yml`
-   Support for blackhole EC2 stress using `blackhole-ec2-stress.yml`


**Prerequisites**

-   [SSM
    Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html)
    (Preinstalled on several Amazon Machine Images)
-   [stress-ng, tc, and
    jq](https://github.com/adhorn/chaos-ssm-documents/blob/master/run-command/install-dependencies.yml)
    (Automatic install of dependencies)

Upload one document at a time
=============================

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
cd chaos-ssm-documents/automation

aws ssm create-document --content file://cpu-stress.yml --name "cpu-stress" --document-type "Command" --document-format YAML
```

Upload all of the SSM Documents to the AWS region of your choice
================================================================

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
cd chaos-ssm-documents/run-command

./upload-document.sh -r eu-west-1 (or other region of your choice)
```

Upload all of the SSM Documents using CloudFormation
====================================================

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
cd chaos-ssm-documents/

run-command/create-cfn.sh run-command/ | tee cfn-chaos-ssm.yml

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ChaosSsm --template-body file://cfn-chaos-ssm.yml
```

Specify AWS region using AWS CLI --region argument.

Once deployed, the stack cannot be updated. Remove existing stack and
re-deploy to apply changes.

SOME WORDS OF CAUTION BEFORE YOU START BREAKING THINGS:
=======================================================

-   To begin with, DO NOT use these chaos injection commands in
    production blindly!!
-   Always review the SSM documents and the commands in them.
-   Make sure your first chaos injections are done in a test environment
    and on test instances where no real and paying customer can
    be affected.
-   Test, test, and test more. Remember that chaos engineering is about
    breaking things in a controlled environment and through well-planned
    experiments to build confidence in your application — and you own
    tools — to withstand turbulent conditions.

One-click Deploy via CloudFormation
